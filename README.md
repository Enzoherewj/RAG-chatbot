# Brothers Karamazov RAG-Chatbot

This project implements a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot that answers questions about "The Brothers Karamazov" by Fyodor Dostoevsky.

## Features

- Uses RAG to provide accurate answers based on the novel's content
- Web interface for easy interaction
- Evaluation metrics for response quality
- User feedback collection
- Retrieval performance evaluation using multiple methods (MinSearch, Chroma Semantic Search, and Hybrid Search)
- Monitoring dashboard with interactive visualizations

## Setup

1. Clone the repository
2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```
   python -m venv rag-chatbot
   source rag-chatbot/bin/activate  # On Windows use `rag-chatbot\Scripts\activate`
   ```
3. Install the required packages:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Create a `.env` file in the project root and add your OpenAI API key:
   ```
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```
5. Ensure you have the "Brothers_Karamazov.txt" file in the project root

## Data Ingestion

Before running the chatbot, you need to ingest the document and create the vectorstore:

1. Run the ingestion script:
   ```
   python ingest.py
   ```
   This will create a `vectorstore` directory with the processed data.

## Running the Chatbot

1. Activate the virtual environment (if not already activated):
   ```
   source rag-chatbot/bin/activate  # On Windows use `rag-chatbot\Scripts\activate`
   ```
2. Start the Flask app:
   ```
   python app.py
   ```
3. Open a web browser and go to `http://localhost:5001`
4. Start chatting with the AI about "The Brothers Karamazov"!

## Project Structure

- `app.py`: Flask application for the web interface
- `rag_chatbot.py`: Core RAG chatbot logic
- `ingest.py`: Script for ingesting the document and creating the vectorstore
- `evaluation.py`: Functions for evaluating response quality
- `templates/index.html`: HTML template for the web interface
- `experiments/test_retreival.py`: Script for evaluating retrieval performance
- `dashboard.py`: Streamlit dashboard for monitoring chatbot performance

## Retrieval Performance Evaluation

To evaluate the retrieval performance:

1. Ensure you're in the `experiments` directory
2. Run the evaluation script:
   ```
   python test_retreival.py
   ```
3. The script will evaluate retrieval performance using:
   - MinSearch
   - Chroma Semantic Search
   - Hybrid Search (combining embedding-based and TF-IDF)
4. Results will be saved in `../vectorstore/retrieval_results.json`

## Monitoring Dashboard

The project includes a Streamlit dashboard for monitoring the chatbot's performance and user interactions.

To view the monitoring dashboard:

1. Ensure you have collected some interaction and feedback data by using the chatbot.
2. Run the Streamlit dashboard:
   ```
   streamlit run dashboard.py
   ```
3. Open your web browser and go to the URL provided by Streamlit (usually `http://localhost:8501`).

The dashboard includes the following interactive visualizations:

1. **Interactions Over Time**: A line chart showing the cumulative number of interactions with the chatbot over time.
2. **User Feedback Distribution**: A pie chart displaying the distribution of helpful vs. not helpful feedback from users.
3. **Average Evaluation Scores Over Time**: A line chart showing how the chatbot's evaluation scores have changed over time.
4. **Query Length Distribution**: A histogram showing the distribution of query lengths, helping to understand the complexity of user questions.
5. **Top 10 Most Common Words in Queries**: A bar chart displaying the most frequently used words in user queries, providing insights into common topics or themes.

These visualizations provide valuable insights into the chatbot's performance, user behavior, and areas for potential improvement.

## Notes

- The chatbot uses OpenAI's GPT model and embeddings
- Responses are generated based on relevant passages from the novel
- User feedback is collected to help improve the chatbot
- The retrieval evaluation compares different methods to find the most effective approach for this specific use case
- The monitoring dashboard helps in tracking the chatbot's performance and user engagement over time

Enjoy exploring "The Brothers Karamazov" with your new AI assistant!

## Docker Deployment

To run the application in a Docker container:

1. Build the Docker image:
   ```
   docker build -t brothers-karamazov-chatbot .
   ```

2. Run the Docker container:
   ```
   docker run -p 5001:5001 -e OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here brothers-karamazov-chatbot
   ```

3. Access the chatbot at `http://localhost:5001` in your web browser.

Note: Make sure to replace `your_api_key_here` with your actual OpenAI API key.
